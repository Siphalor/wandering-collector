This Minecraft mod that takes the Wandering Trader concept from [one of SimplySarc's suggestion videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nF8IQci5us) and implements it.

Whenever a player dropped item despawns/gets destroyed, the stacks get internally added to a list and have a chance to show up next time when trading with a Wandering Trader.

Of course, you can legitimately trade your items back only once ;)
